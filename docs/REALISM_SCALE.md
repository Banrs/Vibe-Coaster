# Realism scaling & element research — how to size and shape MINECOASTER's elements

Status: authoritative, alongside `SHAPES.md` (geometric contract) and `TERRAIN_CONTRACT.md`
(terrain rules). This doc covers the *other* half of V2: how big elements are, how fast they're
taken, how long they last, and what real-world engineering their shapes must match. Read this
before assigning any numeric target (radius, height, speed, duration, g-force) to an element.

**Read `opengl/COASTER_REWRITE.md`'s "Start here" section first if you haven't.** This doc
assumes you're implementing V2 primitives and need to know what number to plug into each one.

## Why this file exists (read this before trusting any number below)

A prior pass on this project got burned twice: it anchored top speed to Kingda Ka (a 2005
coaster, **demolished February 28, 2025** — do not use it as a live reference for anything), and
it once read an element's "height" as relative to local terrain instead of the element's own
raw vertical extent. Both mistakes came from *not verifying against current sources* and *not
stating which quantity a number referred to*. Every figure in this doc is either (a) sourced with
a citation and a confidence flag, or (b) explicitly marked as this project's own derived/estimated
target, never blended together silently. Do the same when you extend this doc: if you can't find
a real citation, say so and mark it as a design estimate — don't present a guess as a fact.

**"Height" and every other size figure below is the element's own raw dimension along its own
axis** (e.g., a drop's height is the vertical descent it produces, a loop's height is its own
vertical diameter) — **never** terrain-relative, never `(track_y_at_point - terrain_y_at_point)`.
Confirm this explicitly in code review if you see height/size logic that reads terrain height as
an input to sizing anything other than clearance validation.

## Core philosophy

MINECOASTER is **arcadey but grounded in real coaster engineering** — a voxel game (Minecraft-style
blocky world) with a modern shader-quality look (dynamic lighting, atmospheric fog/sky, PBR-ish
materials — think "shader Minecraft," not flat/vanilla Minecraft) layered over track and ride
physics that a real coaster engineer's reasoning would recognize, even though the scale and g-forces
exceed anything ASTM would permit. Every element is sized and paced from a **real, currently-verified
world-record (WR) anchor** for that element type, then scaled by the rules below — never invented
from scratch, never guessed from the element's name alone.

**The target is grander than Falcon's Flight**, the current fastest/tallest real coaster (see
below) — this game's default scale sits *above* today's tallest/fastest real ride, not at parity
with it.

**Note: this doc's scope is the track generator's element sizing/pacing.** The rendering/shader
layer (fog, sky, lighting — `render_fx.cpp`, `environment.cpp`, the GLSL shaders) is a **separate**
rewrite target to hit the "shader Minecraft" look, at a full-to-partial rewrite depending on the
subsystem. The recent split of `main.cpp` into `game_state.cpp`/`environment.cpp`/`voxel_render.cpp`/
etc. was a **mechanical reorganization only** — it preserves V1 rendering behavior byte-for-byte
and does **not** represent a finished or authoritative shader implementation. Don't treat those
files' current contents as a target to preserve; they're a starting point to rewrite from.

## Sizing rule: size is *derived* from entry speed, not an independent free parameter

This is the central mechanic, and it replaces the earlier "taper size by element-size-class"
idea floated earlier in this project's history (small elements get more headroom, big elements
capped lower) — **that idea is superseded.** The final rule is simpler and physics-driven:

1. At generation time, the element's **live entry speed** determines its size, by targeting a
   consistent **sustained-g feel** (see the g-force section below) — slower entries produce a
   smaller instance of that element, faster entries produce a larger one. Size is never rolled
   independently of speed.
2. The **built size** (whatever the primary WR dimension is for that element — radius for loops/
   turns/helix, height for drops/hills/top-hats) must land in **1.0x–1.5x of the element's real
   WR anchor**, with headroom for the implementer's judgment to go slightly higher when a specific
   element calls for it. Never below 1.0x — this game's grandest elements always meet or exceed
   the tallest/biggest real example, consistent with "grander than Falcon's Flight."
3. The **entry-speed multiplier** (relative to that element's real-world entry speed) ranges
   roughly **0.75x–1.5x**, and can go slightly higher case-by-case. This is the primary knob;
   size is derived from it, then clamped to the 1.0–1.5x WR size band in rule 2.

### The size-vs-speed relationship — and why it can't be the classic v²/g formula

V1 used (see `opengl/src/coaster_track.cpp`'s `recCapMul`/`invRAt`) a classic constant-g radius
formula: `r = v² / ((n−1)·g·mul)` — radius scales with the **square** of entry speed to hold a
*constant* g-force regardless of speed. **Do not reuse this relationship in V2.** Here's the
problem, worked through: transit time through an element scales roughly as `t ≈ (path length)/v`.
If radius (and therefore path length) scales as `v²`, transit time scales as `t ∝ v² / v = v` —
i.e., a 2x-faster element would take roughly **2x as long** to ride through under the classic
formula. That's the wrong direction entirely — see the target below.

**Concrete target (from the user directly, supersedes the vaguer "slightly less" framing this doc
started with): transit time is latched to the real-world element's transit time, but roughly
20–30% shorter, and that reduction comes specifically from the speed multiplier exceeding the size
multiplier** (`entry-speed multiplier > size multiplier`, both relative to the real element) —
not from an arbitrary time formula. Worked through: `t = (path length)/v ∝ r/v`, so
`t_game/t_real = (r_game/r_real) / (v_game/v_real) = k_r / k_v` where `k_r` is the size multiplier
(1.0–1.5x WR, rule 2 above) and `k_v` is the entry-speed multiplier (0.75–1.5x+ real, rule 3
above). **Target `k_r / k_v ≈ 0.70–0.80`** to land in the 20–30%-shorter band. Concretely: at a
high entry-speed multiplier (`k_v` toward 1.5), size should sit toward the lower-middle of its
1.0–1.5x band (`k_r` around 1.05–1.2) to hit that ratio; at the low end of the speed range
(`k_v` near 0.75, i.e. slower-than-real entries), the hard `k_r ≥ 1.0` size floor will dominate
and the ratio won't hit 20–30%-shorter exactly — that's expected, not a contradiction, since the
floor rule ("never below WR size") takes precedence over the timing target at that extreme.

And g-force (`g = v²/r ∝ v² / v^~1 = v^~1`, since `k_r` grows much more slowly than `k_v` under
the ratio above) grows noticeably with speed under this relationship, which is exactly
"g-forces proportional to the speed/size increases" — the timing target and the g-scaling intent
are two views of the same `k_r/k_v` relationship, not competing constraints. **This ratio is this
project's own derivation from the user's stated intent, not a sourced real-world constant** — no
published source ties coaster radius to entry speed by any formula (confirmed absent in the
per-element research below). Treat `k_r/k_v ≈ 0.70–0.80` as the working target to verify
empirically against real transit times once V2's audit/continuity harness exists, not as a fixed
law — and re-derive per element family since the real-world transit-time baseline differs by
element (see per-element notes below for what's actually sourced vs. estimated).

**Illustrative example the user gave (explicitly not literal, don't hardcode these numbers):** a
100 km/h real loop taking ~3s should map to a ~200 km/h game loop taking roughly ~2.25–2.5s
(a 17–25% reduction, in the same direction as the 20–30% target above) — not ~6s (naive v²
doubling) and not ~3s flat (naive "same size, just faster"). Use the `k_r/k_v` relationship above,
not this specific example, to compute actual targets per element.

**Refinement (user, 2026-07-09, supersedes a strict reading of the 0.70–0.80 band):** the ratio
band and the size band can conflict — at `k_v ≤ 1.5`, holding `k_r/k_v ≤ 0.80` caps `k_r` at
~1.2, which keeps every element away from the top of its 1.0–1.5x WR size band. When that
happens (i.e., when `k_r/k_v` "seems low" for the size the element wants), **slide the ratio
toward ~1.0 — transit time ≈ the real element's time — so built size can reach the ~1.5x WR
scale.** Treat `k_r/k_v ∈ [0.9, 1.1]` as the working range. **All of these
user-given numbers are soft targets, not precise constants: within ±5% is good, within ±10% is
acceptable, closer is better.** That tolerance philosophy applies to the user's other numeric
targets in this doc too, unless one is explicitly marked as a hard cap.

**Consequence for planner speed targets (user re-confirmed 2026-07-10: transit stays ~1x in BOTH
directions — do not let it drift to ~1.25x through under-scaled entry speeds):** with sizes
locked at ~1.4–1.5x WR, **`k_v ≈ k_r` per element** — each element's in-game entry speed is its
real anchor entry speed × its size multiplier (flagship camelback anchored to Falcon's ~250 km/h
entry wants ~100 m/s in-game, not 82). Where the live route arrives far above an element's
matched entry, shed the excess with geometry (conditioning climbs, ride ordering) — climbs
capped at a sane height, after which the entry may run up to ~1.7x real with size at the band
top, per the standing "user accepts the higher g" position and the soft tolerances.

### The real physics of curve shape vs. g-force (peer-reviewed, use this for within-element curve design)

The `k_r/k_v` ratio above governs how an element's *overall* size scales with entry speed — a
coarse, whole-element parameter. Separately, real peer-reviewed physics answers the finer-grained
question of how the track's curve shape *within* an element should relate to g-force at each point,
and this project should use it rather than inventing curve shapes. Three papers, all peer-reviewed
and directly on-topic (not adjacent-field):

- **Müller, "Roller coasters without differential equations," *European Journal of Physics* 31
  (2010) 835.** Derives a general force formula for *any* track shape `y = f(x)`:
  `F_C = [2|f''(x)| / (1+f'(x)²)^1.5] · (E_tot − m·g·f(x)) + sign(f''(x))/√(1+f'(x)²) · m·g`.
  For a parabolic hill `y = −c·x²`, this reduces at the crest to `F_C(top) = 4c·E_tot − mg`. The
  key result: a hill shaped as the **exact free-fall parabola** for the car's crest speed
  (`c = g/(2v₀²)`) gives `F_C = 0` everywhere — true sustained 0g. **Shape the crest curve
  *tighter* than that matching parabola** (smaller radius of curvature than free-fall would trace)
  **to get negative g ("airtime")** — this is confirmed against real accelerometer data on a dive
  coaster's first drop by Pendrill & Eager (2020, below), who found measured negative g traces
  directly to "the shape of the track being a more narrow parabola than would correspond to an
  object leaving the top of the track in pure free fall."
- **Pendrill & Eager, "Velocity, acceleration, jerk, snap and vibration," *Physics Education* 55
  (2020) 065012.** Confirms the above against real ride telemetry; also the source for this
  project's jerk/transition-smoothness reasoning (see `SHAPES.md`).
- **Nordmark & Essén, "The comfortable roller coaster – on the shape of tracks with constant
  normal force," *European Journal of Physics* 31 (2010) 1307.** Solves the harder problem this
  project actually needs for zero-g stalls and any "hold a target g over an extended arc" element:
  what track shape gives a **constant-magnitude normal force over a whole arc**, not just an
  instant. Answer: the required curve is related to the **Kepler orbit problem** — trajectories in
  velocity space are conic sections (ellipse/parabola/hyperbola depending on the target g-to-gravity
  ratio), **not a simple polynomial of any fixed order**. The ordinary free-fall parabola is just
  the zero-g limiting case of this family. **Do not assume a zero-g stall's crest is a quartic** —
  no source (including this one) confirms that; if a closed-form curve is wanted for the stall's
  extended-hold arc, derive it from this paper's conic-section construction, or numerically match
  a spline to a constant-g target instead of assuming a fixed polynomial order.
- **Pendrill, "Rollercoaster loop shapes," *Physics Education* 40 (2005) 517.** Gives the working
  recipe for constant-g loop segments: `1/r = (1/h)(h₀/r₀ + (cosθ₀ − cosθ)/2)` relates local radius
  to height and track angle for a segment held at constant centripetal g — this is the real-world
  basis for "loops are composites of clothoid + constant-g arcs," not a single closed-form curve
  either.

Net guidance: **don't hand-pick a polynomial degree for any crest/arc shape.** Use Müller's general
force formula to evaluate any candidate curve's g-force profile directly, and Nordmark & Essén's
construction (or a numerically-fit spline against it) when a target is "hold constant g over an
arc" rather than "pass through one crest point." This is a stronger, more precise tool than the
degree-5 (`quinticC2`) crest formula V1 used for top hats (see `SHAPES.md`) — worth re-deriving
V1's crest shapes against these formulas rather than carrying the old polynomial forward unverified.

### Target speeds

- **Top speed**: ~375 km/h = 1.5x Falcon's Flight's 250 km/h (sourced below).
- **Average speed** (ride-cycle average, not top speed): ~225 km/h flat target — not a multiplier
  of anything, a direct design target.

### Process requirement: ask before locking in per-element targets

When you build the WR-anchor table (per element or per element family), **surface the researched
data to the user and ask what target size/multiplier they want for that element or family**
before hardcoding it — don't unilaterally pick a number within the 1.0–1.5x band and move on,
especially for elements where the research below found no solid real-world anchor (turn radius,
corkscrew roll rate — see gaps below). The user may want specific elements pushed toward the top
or bottom of the range for pacing/variety reasons that aren't derivable from research alone.

## Locked element targets (user decisions, 2026-07-10 — supersede "provisional" markers)

Confirmed via the ask-before-locking-in process; the ±5%/±10% soft-tolerance rule applies:

| Decision | Value | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| Signature element size | **~1.4–1.5x WR** ("grand"), `k_r/k_v ≈ 0.95–1.0` (transit ≈ real time) | User pick; anchors per element below |
| Top hat (signature) | **~230 m** rise | 1.4x Falcon's Flight 163 m structure |
| Camelback (flagship) | **~240 m** | 1.45x Falcon's 165 m airtime hill; smaller instances scale down with entry speed (see note below) |
| Vertical loop | **~78 m** | 1.43x Tormenta 54.6 m |
| Immelmann | **~95 m** | 1.43x Tormenta 66.4 m |
| Main drop | **~280 m** | 1.44x Falcon's 195 m elevation drop |
| Corkscrew roll rate | **90–100°/s** (S5-eased ends) | User pick over a GENUINE data gap — **flagged: re-research if real data ever surfaces**; radius from the loop family scaled down (~10–14 m, design estimate) |
| Zero-g stall hold | **2–2.5 s** inverted weightless hold | User pick; real anchor is a weak ~2 s estimate (Pantheon) |
| Inversions per lap | **1–3** | User pick (was 2–4 in V1-era rules) |
| Inversion roster | loop, Immelmann, dive loop, corkscrew, zero-g stall — **banana roll, heartline roll, wingover/overbank-inversion, pretzel stay excluded** | User re-confirmed the old exclusions |

**Instance-size note (this project's interpretation, flag if wrong):** the 1.0x floor binds each
element family's *flagship* instance (the grandest camelback ≥ its WR anchor); smaller instances
of repeatable elements (hills, loops in multi-inversion stretches) scale down with live entry
speed per the sizing rule, bounded below by the small end of that family's real examples (e.g.
El Toro-class 25–34 m hills), not by the flagship anchor.

## g-force scaling

Real coasters publish sparse, inconsistent g-force *records* (see per-element notes below —
several elements have **no sourced peak/sustained-g figure at all**). Where a real figure exists,
target roughly proportional scaling with the speed multiplier applied (the `k_r/k_v ≈ 0.70–0.80`
relationship above means g grows close to linearly with the speed multiplier `k_v`) — but don't
force a number where none exists; note it as a design estimate. Separately from the *target*
number, the *mechanism* for hitting any g target at a given point is not a gap — use Müller
(2010)'s general force formula above to compute exactly what g a candidate curve produces, rather
than tuning by feel. **Never manage g by braking** (carried forward from the prior REALISM.md's
hard rule, still correct) — g is a geometry output, not a speed input.

## Element occurrence & density

- Falcon's Flight and Formula Rossa — this project's two primary real-world anchors — both have
  **zero inversions**. This game should have **a few, not zero and not many** — noticeably fewer
  than a dedicated inversion coaster, but present, unlike its real anchors. Don't treat "zero
  inversions" as the target; the old REALISM.md's "2–4 inversions/lap" range is a reasonable
  starting point to re-validate against the new size/speed rules, not a fixed carry-over.
- Element density (elements per lap/minute) should be **similar to real coasters, adjusted slightly
  lower** to account for elements being physically bigger (bigger elements eat more track length
  and time per instance, so fewer fit in the same ride duration at similar pacing quality).
- Historical note requiring reconfirmation, not silent inheritance: a past decision (recorded in
  git history, `REALISM.md` as of commit `782e56d^`) removed banana roll, heartline roll, and
  overbanked turn (WINGOVER) from generation per a past "roll overload" complaint. Re-confirm with
  the user whether that still holds under the new V2 element roster rather than assuming it does —
  everything is being rewritten, so old exclusions aren't automatically still wanted.

## Research workflow — required for any new element, before writing generator code

This is the standing process for researching *any* element this doc doesn't already cover (and
for re-verifying one that's gone stale). **Do the steps in this order — don't jump to a number.**
The per-element entries below are worked examples of this same process; read a couple before
applying it to something new.

1. **Geometry/shape first.** What is the actual curve family — clothoid, circular arc, parabolic,
   quintic, a Kepler-conic-section construction, a composite of several? Don't assume from the
   element's name; find or derive the real shape (see the "Transition curves" and "real physics of
   curve shape" sections above for the general toolkit — Müller's force formula, Nordmark &
   Essén's constant-normal-force construction, the clothoid-transition patent). State the shape
   explicitly in whatever you write, even if the answer is "no source specifies this, defaulting
   to X because Y."
2. **Size.** Find the current (re-verify the opening date — see the vertical-loop entry above for
   why "current" can't be trusted from a records page alone) real-world WR anchor for the primary
   dimension(s) — and don't stop at height/radius alone if other dimensions matter (a turn's angle
   *and* radius, a helix's radius *and* rotation count, a corkscrew's radius *and* roll rate).
3. **Other corroborating info** — speed at the element, transit time, g-force (peak and
   sustained), and which specific coaster each figure comes from. Cross-check dimensional and
   kinematic figures against each other where possible (e.g., does a claimed radius + speed
   produce a plausible g via `g=v²/r`? If not, one of the two figures is probably wrong or
   mismatched in source).
4. **Cite everything with a traceable link**, name the specific coaster (not "a real coaster" —
   which one), and mark a confidence level (peer-reviewed / official manufacturer / RCDB-or-
   Wikipedia / enthusiast forum or fan wiki / this project's own derived estimate). A number
   without a link, a coaster name, and a shape/confidence note is not acceptable — that's "a
   number plopped in," exactly what this doc exists to avoid. If a real search genuinely turns up
   nothing, say so explicitly as a gap (see the gaps list below for the template) rather than
   inventing a plausible-sounding figure.
5. **Only then** derive the game target (apply the size/speed/g rules above) and write it into the
   generator — and if step 2–3 turned up no solid anchor for that element, follow the "ask before
   locking in" rule above rather than picking a number unilaterally.

## Per-element research

Every entry below is from live 2026 web research (not training-data recall) specifically to avoid
repeating the Kingda-Ka-class mistake. Confidence is stated per fact; where research found **no**
real data, that's stated explicitly as a gap, with a recommendation for how to proceed (derive
from physics, or ask the user) rather than inventing a number.

### Primary speed/launch anchors

**Falcon's Flight** (Six Flags Qiddiya City, Saudi Arabia; Intamin LSM launch; opened December 31,
2025 — current, not historical): top speed **250 km/h (155 mph)**, confirmed current record.
Height figures have a real, sourced ambiguity worth preserving rather than flattening: Intamin's
own marketing cites **195 m** as the ride's headline "height," while RCDB/Wikipedia describe
**163 m** as the structure height and 195 m as the total *elevation change* — the extra ~32 m comes
from the natural Tuwaiq escarpment the ride launches down into, not steel structure. Use **163 m**
for "structure height" and **195 m** for "total elevation drop" as two distinct quantities, not
interchangeably. The ride features an LSM climb to the cliff, an **outward-banked summit turn**
(confirmed by multiple sources, but **no numeric bank angle is published anywhere** — flag as a
gap if a specific angle is needed), then a near-vertical dive down the natural cliff face.
Sources: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcons_Flight), [Six Flags Qiddiya City official](https://sixflagsqiddiyacity.com/en/explore/rides/falcons-flight), [Intamin project page](https://www.intamin.com/project/falcons-flight/).

**Formula Rossa** (Ferrari World Abu Dhabi; Intamin hydraulic-accumulator launch, not flywheel;
opened 2010, record re-verified January 2026): top speed **240 km/h (149.1 mph)** reached in
**4.9 s**. **Correction to a figure the old REALISM.md conflated**: the commonly-cited **4.8g is
the peak g-force found *anywhere* on the ride, not the launch g** — launch g is **1.7g**. Formula
Rossa reclaimed a narrower "fastest launch acceleration" sub-record in Jan 2026, but Falcon's
Flight remains the fastest coaster overall. Sources: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_Rossa), [Guinness World Records, Jan 2026](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2026/4/formula-rossa-achieves-highest-ever-rollercoaster-launch-speed-to-extend-record-legacy).

### Vertical loop

**Two live numbers, both traceable, and a lesson in verification lag**: Guinness World Records'
official page (last verified June 13, 2019) lists the record as a **42.52 m (139 ft 6 in)** tie
between **"Flash"** (Lewa Adventure, Shaanxi, China, opened 2016) and **"Hyper Coaster"** (Land of
Legends, Antalya, Turkey, opened 2018) — [Guinness World Records, "Largest roller coaster loop"](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/111031-largest-roller-coaster-loop).
But a newer coaster has since exceeded it and Guinness's page simply hasn't caught up yet:
**Tormenta Rampaging Run** (Six Flags Over Texas, Bolliger & Mabillard steel dive coaster) —
**opened July 9, 2026** (the same date as this research) — has a **179 ft (54.6 m)** vertical
loop, now the tallest built. Source: [Tormenta Rampaging Run — Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tormenta_Rampaging_Run),
corroborated by [Fort Worth Report, "Six Flags breaks six world records with new ride"](https://fortworthreport.org/2026/07/08/six-flags-breaks-six-world-records-with-new-ride/).
**Lesson for future research passes: check both the record-tracking site (Guinness/RCDB) AND
recent opening-date news for the same element type — official record pages lag real openings by
months to years, and citing only the "official" page can silently reproduce a stale number even
when it links to a real source.**

**Shape**: real loops are **not circular** — they're a **clothoid/teardrop shape** (this design
choice traces to Werner Stengel's 1976 work, the origin of the modern coaster loop), radius
tightest at the top and wider at the bottom. This is a deliberate g-force-management shape: a
true circular loop would produce dangerously high g at the bottom (where speed is highest) to
match a survivable g at the top (where speed is lowest); varying the radius continuously keeps g
within a bounded range throughout. Source: [Gizmodo, "Why Roller Coaster Loops Are Never Circular"](https://gizmodo.com/why-roller-coaster-loops-are-never-circular-1549063718)
(pop-science, but accurately summarizes the mechanism), corroborated by the peer-reviewed transition-
curve sources in the "Transition curves" section below. **Confidence: high** for the clothoid/
teardrop shape claim; the specific "Werner Stengel 1976" attribution is widely repeated but wasn't
independently re-verified against a primary source in this pass — flag if a hard citation for that
specific claim is needed. No sourced numeric transit-time-vs-height relationship was found for any
loop — derive one from the `k_r/k_v` relationship above, or measure empirically once implemented.

**V2 implementation note (2026-07-10, this project's own construction, derived from the cited
toolkit):** `emitLoop` builds the teardrop as S5 clothoid entry/exit ramps around a
**constant-centripetal arc** — `κ(y) = a_C / v²(y)` with energy-conserving `v²(y)` — which is
automatically tightest at the top (the teardrop property); `a_C` is bisected so the loop's raw
height matches the spec. Felt g (Müller's formula) is `a_C/g + cosθ`: measured at a 70 m loop with
40 m/s entry, top ≈ **1.05 g at 54 km/h** — physically in line with real loops. This is a
project-derived construction consistent with (not lifted from) Pendrill 2005's constant-g-segment
recipe; the alternative (their exact `1/r` θ-formula) can be swapped in later if a closer match to
a specific real loop profile is ever wanted. A planar loop's entry/exit tracks cross in the loop
plane — real Stengel loops incline slightly; that tilt/offset is a **planner placement concern**
(step 6), noted in `track_primitives.cpp`.

### Immelmann / dive loop / pretzel loop

These are geometrically distinct, half-loop-derived inversions. **Correction to an assumption in
this project's own history**: "pretzel loop" is specifically a **B&M flying-coaster element**
(seen on Tatsu), not an RMC element — don't conflate it with RMC's dive-loop-family shapes when
citing a real anchor. Immelmann = climb + half-loop + half-twist to exit inverted-then-upright
(named for the WWI aerial maneuver, a half-loop-plus-roll); dive loop = the reverse, entering
inverted-ish and diving out. **Current Immelmann record, same coaster as the loop record above**:
**Tormenta Rampaging Run**'s Immelmann is **218 ft (66.4 m) tall**, tallest on record as of its
July 9, 2026 opening — [Tormenta Rampaging Run — Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tormenta_Rampaging_Run).
(This matches a figure — "Tormenta Rampaging Run 66.4 m" — that appeared in this project's own
pre-reorg `REALISM.md`; that figure turns out to have been directionally correct even before this
coaster had opened, evidently sourced from pre-opening manufacturer specs — but always re-verify
against a live source rather than trusting an inherited number, since the coincidence doesn't
generalize.) No further dimensional/kinematic detail for the dive-loop shape specifically was
found with strong sourcing in this pass — treat its radius/transit-time targets as derived from
the loop's scaling relationship until a dedicated research pass finds a better anchor.

### Corkscrew / barrel roll

**Genuine data gap, not a search failure**: real-world corkscrew **radius records and roll rate
(dθ/dt, degrees/second) are not published anywhere** — not by manufacturers, not by RCDB
([rcdb.com](https://rcdb.com/)), not in academic literature (checked against the peer-reviewed
sources in the transition-curve section below, none of which give a coaster corkscrew a numeric
roll rate). The only figure surfaced anywhere was a weakly-sourced, forum-derived estimate of
**~97.5°/s average** for a *helix* (not a corkscrew specifically) on **Goliath** (Six Flags Great
America) — this traces to enthusiast-forum arithmetic (CoasterBuzz/CoasterForce discussion threads,
not independently verifiable), treat as a rough directional reference only, not a corkscrew fact,
and do not cite it as sourced. **Recommendation: this is exactly the kind of element to bring to
the user directly** (per the "ask before locking in" rule above) rather than inventing a number —
propose a roll-rate range grounded in rider-comfort reasoning (see the clothoid/transition section
below for the general jerk-management principle: roll *rate* should ease in/out, not jump to a
constant dθ/dt instantly) and confirm it.

### Helix

No solid real-world radius record was found for any named coaster. The only duration/rotation
reference found — **Goliath**'s helix at ~585° total rotation, ~4.5g sustained, ~6s duration — is
**the same weakly-sourced enthusiast-forum derivation as the corkscrew roll-rate estimate above**
(not an independent citation), re-verify before hardcoding or find a stronger primary source. No
source describes whether real helix bank angle is held constant or varied through the turn —
assume constant-bank (a simple circular-in-plan, constant-radius, constant-bank spiral) as the
simpler, defensible default absent contrary evidence, and flag this as an assumption in code
comments if you implement it. **Shape**, where sourced: a helix is a true 3D spiral — `x,z` trace
a circle, `y` descends (or climbs) continuously and linearly with rotation angle `φ`
(`y = y₀ − p·φ/2π` for pitch `p`) — this is geometric convention, not something requiring a
citation beyond basic spiral parameterization (already specified in `opengl/COASTER_REWRITE.md`'s
primitive table).

### Turn (banked) / S-curve / overbanked turns

Strong, specific, well-sourced *angle* data exists for several real coasters' overbanked turns —
but **turn radius is a total gap**: no official or enthusiast source (including RCDB) publishes a
radius figure for any of the coasters below. Shape: an overbanked turn is a **circular-arc plan**
(constant-radius through the turn's body) with a **clothoid entry/exit transition** (see the
Transition curves section right below) — the angle figures here describe the *bank angle held
through the arc*, not the plan-view curve shape, which is separately governed by the clothoid
transition rule. Angle data:

| Coaster | Overbank angle(s) | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Millennium Force (Cedar Point) | 122° (tallest of 3, 169 ft/52 m) — cited as a world record *at 2000 opening*, unconfirmed whether still standing as of 2026 | [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Force), [Millennium Force official fact sheet, via Ultimate Rollercoaster](https://www.ultimaterollercoaster.com/coasters/new00/cp_millennium/cp_mf_facts.shtml) |
| Fury 325 (Carowinds) | 91° ("horseshoe turn", 157 ft/48 m) | [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fury_325) |
| Iron Rattler (Six Flags Fiesta Texas) | 110°, 95°, 98°, 93° (four distinct turns) | [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Rattler) |
| Maverick (Cedar Point) | 92° | [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maverick_(roller_coaster)) |
| Twisted Colossus (Six Flags Magic Mountain) | 90° ("High Five", both parallel tracks — exactly 90°, not technically overbanked) | [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twisted_Colossus) |
| Goliath (Six Flags Great America) | unspecified angle, 125 ft/38 m | [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goliath_(Six_Flags_Great_America)) |

General definition (enthusiast wiki, moderate confidence): overbanked turns are generally
100–120°, bounded above by 135° where a turn becomes classified as an inversion instead. Source:
[Coasterpedia, "Over-banked curve"](https://coasterpedia.net/wiki/Over-banked_curve).

**Important cautionary data point**: **Intimidator 305 / Pantherian** (Kings Dominion)'s original
270° turn following its 300 ft first drop produced **sustained g over 5g**, causing rider
grey-outs/blackouts at its 2010 opening. The park's fix was **not** to add brakes or cut speed
permanently — it was to **physically reprofile the turn with a wider radius** in the off-season,
after which trims were removed and full speed restored. This is a direct, real precedent for
"manage g via geometry, not braking" (the hard rule carried from the prior REALISM.md) — and a
cautionary example of what happens when turn radius doesn't scale with speed. Source:
[Pantherian — Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantherian).

Standard banking-angle physics (adjacent field, well-established, not coaster-specific but
directly applicable, no single citable URL since it's textbook circular-motion algebra):
`tan(θ) = v² / (r·g)` relates bank angle, radius, and speed for a zero-lateral-force banked turn —
use this as the baseline relationship, then apply the size/speed scaling rules above to pick `r`
from target entry speed.

### Transition curves — how banking/pitch actually evolves through an element

This directly answers the "how does pitch/roll evolve" requirement, and is **confirmed by a real
coaster-specific engineering patent**, not just adjacent-field theory: **[US Patent 4,693,183A](https://patents.google.com/patent/US4693183A/en)**
(Pötzsch, 1987) explicitly describes coaster track using **clothoid (Euler spiral) transitions** —
radius of curvature inversely proportional to arc length (`r = A/s`) — to smoothly reduce radius
from a straight section into a curved one, explicitly to keep the vehicle "free of transverse
force" during the transition. This is corroborated by peer-reviewed sources: [Eager et al., *Physics
Education* (2020)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6552/aba732) (same paper as
Pendrill & Eager above) confirms modern coasters use "clothoids and space curves" specifically to
bound **jerk** (rate of change of acceleration) during transitions, contrasting with older
coasters' abrupt constant-radius-to-constant-radius joins. A generalizable formal constraint (from
an adjacent railway-transition-curve patent, **[US Patent 7,027,966B2](https://patents.google.com/patent/US7027966B2/en)**):
a well-behaved transition requires the **second derivative of bank/roll angle to be zero at both
ends of the transition** — i.e., no sudden kink in how fast the roll rate itself is changing, not
just the roll angle. **No official manufacturer (B&M/Intamin/RMC) publishes a numeric jerk limit or
roll-rate-of-change standard** — this is a real gap; SHAPES.md's own C2-continuity requirement
(position/tangent/curvature agree at joins) is this project's answer to the same problem and should
be treated as the operative standard, not a further real-world number search.

### Camelback / airtime hill

| Coaster | Height | Notes | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| El Toro (Six Flags Great Adventure) | 112/100/82 ft hills, 176 ft first drop @ 76° | | [RCDB](https://rcdb.com/3183.htm), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Toro_(Six_Flags_Great_Adventure)) |
| Steel Vengeance (Cedar Point) | 116 ft outward-banked hill (205 ft overall height) | **27.2s total airtime across the whole ride** — current record, but this is a whole-ride aggregate, not per-hill | [RCDB](https://rcdb.com/15411.htm), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel_Vengeance), [RMC official](https://rockymtnconstruction.com/roller-coaster/steel-vengeance/) |
| Goliath (Six Flags Great America) | 165 ft structure + 15 ft below-grade tunnel = **180 ft total drop** | Clean, well-documented example of drop exceeding structure height via an excavated section — a good real-world precedent for this project's own "raw element height, not terrain-relative" convention, since here the *extra* height is a deliberate design choice (dig a trench), not a measurement bug | [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goliath_(Six_Flags_Great_America)), [RCDB](https://rcdb.com/9972.htm), [RMC official](https://rockymtnconstruction.com/roller-coaster/goliath/) |
| Millennium Force (Cedar Point) | 182 ft parabolic hill, crosses a lagoon | Reference datum (water surface vs ground) is ambiguous in every source checked | [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Force), [RCDB](https://rcdb.com/594.htm) |
| Iron Gwazi (Busch Gardens Tampa) | 206 ft, 91° beyond-vertical drop | | [RCDB](https://rcdb.com/16985.htm), [Busch Gardens official](https://buschgardens.com/tampa/roller-coasters/iron-gwazi/), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Gwazi) |

**No source gives per-hill transit time or a reliable numeric negative-g figure** for any specific
hill on any of these — g-force claims found (e.g. El Toro "-2g") trace to a single uncited
Wikipedia line or enthusiast forum post, not an instrumented reading. Treat hill airtime-g targets
as this project's own design estimate, informed by the qualitative "floater" (gentle, sustained)
vs "ejector" (violent, sharp) distinction, not a sourced number. **The shape mechanism is not a
gap, though** — real, peer-reviewed physics (Müller 2010, confirmed against measured accelerometer
data by Pendrill & Eager 2020, both cited above) establishes that a crest gives **negative g
("airtime") exactly when it's curved tighter than the free-fall parabola matching the car's crest
speed** — a hill shaped as the exact free-fall parabola gives true 0g, not negative g. Use this
directly: pick a target negative-g value, compute the free-fall-matching parabola for the entry
speed, then curve the crest tighter by whatever margin the target g requires (via Müller's
`F_C(top) = 4c·E_tot − mg` relation). "Floater" (gentle) vs "ejector" (sharp) is a matter of degree
on this same continuum — floater = crest curved only slightly tighter than free-fall, ejector =
noticeably tighter — not a fundamentally different construction.

### Top hat

Kingda Ka (once the tallest top-hat tower at 456 ft, Six Flags Great Adventure) is **confirmed
demolished February 28, 2025** — cite it only as a historical/dead reference, never as a current
anchor (this is the exact mistake this project needs to stop making; no single traceable link was
retained for the demolition date in this pass — re-verify with a direct search if this fact is
load-bearing anywhere). **Top Thrill 2**'s (Cedar Point) tower uses a **90° vertical ascent with a
twist near the crest**, not a simple constant-angle face — shape: effectively two 90°-pitch
straight faces joined by a curvature-continuous twisting crest transition, not a single continuous
curve. Falcon's Flight's climb (see the Primary speed/launch anchors entry above, with full
sourcing) is this project's primary current top-hat/summit anchor at 163 m structure height.

### Zero-g stall

**Correction to a premise this project's history may have implicitly carried**: a zero-g stall is
**fully an inversion** (rider goes upside-down), not a non-inverting airtime element — confirmed
across [RCDB's zero-g stall listing](https://rcdb.com/12189.htm) (27 coasters, classified as 1
inversion each), [Wikipedia's roller-coaster-element taxonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roller_coaster_element),
and the [park.fan glossary](https://park.fan/en/glossary/zero-g-stall). The real distinction from
a "zero-g roll": a **roll** twists a continuous 360° through a hill crest (B&M signature, e.g.
**Alpengeist**, **Montu**, **The Incredible Hulk**) with no pause — weightlessness is a brief
passing moment. A **stall** (RMC signature) twists 180° to fully inverted, **pauses/holds**
inverted through a straight-or-gently-curved section, then twists the remaining 180° back upright —
the pause is what extends "hang time." Sourced hang-time figures are sparse and low-confidence:
**Pantheon** (Busch Gardens Williamsburg) ~2s, a reviewer's own estimate not an instrumented
reading — [Coaster101](https://www.coaster101.com/2022/04/08/six-of-the-most-surprising-elements-on-pantheon/);
**VelociCoaster** (Universal Islands of Adventure) "hundred foot long," no seconds given —
[Coaster101](https://www.coaster101.com/2021/06/24/a-no-expense-spared-review-of-jurassic-world-velocicoaster/);
**ArieForce One** (Fun Spot Atlanta) "largest Zero-G Stall in America," a marketing claim from the
park CEO relayed by one outlet, no measurement — [Coaster101](https://www.coaster101.com/2021/11/16/fun-spot-atlanta-announces-arieforce-one-rmc-roller-coaster/).
**No instrumented
peak-g figure exists anywhere for either a zero-g roll or a zero-g stall** on any real coaster —
do not cite a specific g number as fact for this element. **On shape**: a common assumption that a
stall's crest/hold arc is a quartic (degree-4 polynomial) curve is **not confirmed by any source**
found in this research, including a targeted search for RMC engineering patents. The rigorous
peer-reviewed answer for "hold a near-constant g over an extended arc" (Nordmark & Essén 2010,
cited above) is that the correct curve family is derived from the **Kepler orbit problem** —
conic-section trajectories in velocity space, not a fixed-degree polynomial. If V1's stall/hold
logic uses a quartic, treat that as an unverified inherited assumption to re-derive against
Nordmark & Essén rather than carry forward as-is.

### Cliff dive

This project's existing natural-escarpment cliff-dive concept (see `SHAPES.md`) is directly modeled
on Falcon's Flight's real mechanic (LSM climb to a natural cliff edge, outward-banked summit turn,
near-vertical dive down the cliff face) — see the Falcon's Flight entry above for the sourced
detail. No other real coaster does this at comparable scale, so Falcon's Flight is the sole
real-world anchor for this element; everything else here is this project's own design extrapolation
(already governed by `TERRAIN_CONTRACT.md`'s escarpment-scan rules).

## Summary of genuine research gaps (don't fabricate numbers for these)

- Corkscrew/barrel-roll radius and roll rate (dθ/dt) — not published anywhere.
- Turn/S-curve radius for any named real coaster — angle data exists, radius does not.
- Per-hill airtime transit time (seconds) — only whole-ride totals are published.
- Numeric jerk limits or roll-rate-of-change standards from any manufacturer.
- Instrumented peak-g for zero-g rolls/stalls, corkscrews, or helices.
- Helix and corkscrew dimensional records generally (weak, low-confidence derived figures only).

For all of these: either derive a target from the physics relationships in this doc (banking
formula, C2-continuity/clothoid transition requirement, the `k_r/k_v` size-vs-speed ratio), or
bring it to the user as an open design choice — don't present an invented number as if it were
sourced.

## File-organization convention (applies to this rewrite generally)

Keep new files at a level a single LLM context can hold and navigate without excessive
searching — group related concerns into one file rather than fragmenting into many tiny files.
The V2 module split in `opengl/COASTER_REWRITE.md` (7 files under `opengl/src/track/`) and the
recent `main.cpp` host-code split (7 files: `game_state.cpp`, `environment.cpp`,
`voxel_render.cpp`, `spline.cpp`, `coaster_car.cpp`, `presentation.cpp`, `audit_diagnostics.cpp`)
are both calibrated to this — don't split further without a concrete reason (a file that's
genuinely become too large to hold in context, not just "this could be two files").
