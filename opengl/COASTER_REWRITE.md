# Procedural Track V2

Status: authoritative implementation brief. Do **not** add corrective passes to the V1
generator. V2 is a **full, ground-up rewrite** — not a refactor, not a cleanup, not a port. V1
stays in the tree only so the game keeps building/running while V2 is developed alongside it, and
as a *conceptual* pointer to which element names/behaviors need to exist (a loop, a top hat, a
helix) — it is **not** a proper reference for *how* to build any of them. V1 is the ten days of
overlapping, conflicting patches that caused this rewrite; treat its actual code, formulas, and
approach as untrustworthy by default, not as prior art to consult, port, or match output against.

## Start here

1. Read this file in full, then [`docs/SHAPES.md`](../docs/SHAPES.md),
   [`docs/TERRAIN_CONTRACT.md`](../docs/TERRAIN_CONTRACT.md), and
   [`docs/REALISM_SCALE.md`](../docs/REALISM_SCALE.md) (element sizing/speed/pacing rules and the
   real-world research behind every number — read this before assigning any size, speed, or
   duration target to an element).
2. Do not open `coaster_track.cpp` planning to patch it — and do not open it planning to *learn
   from* it either. It's not a working reference to consult for "how does V1 do X" before writing
   the V2 version; it's the untrusted output of ten days of overlapping patches, which is why V2
   exists. Any fix for a symptom described below goes into the new `opengl/src/track/` modules,
   built from this doc's primitives and real-world research, not from reading V1's code.
3. First concrete step is Migration sequence item 1: create the `opengl/src/track/` module
   skeleton and a `TrackV2` adapter that matches the existing `Track` interface, with no V1
   behavior changes. Do not begin with turns/inversions/terrain — line, connector, top-hat,
   camelback, and drop come first, per item 2.
4. If you find yourself writing a smoothing pass, a terrain-floor ratchet, or a per-sample pitch
   edit, stop — that is exactly the pattern this rewrite exists to remove (see "What to remove
   or quarantine" below).
5. Before hardcoding any element's size/speed/duration target, follow `REALISM_SCALE.md`'s "ask
   before locking in" rule — surface the researched WR data and confirm the target with the user,
   especially for elements where no solid real-world anchor exists (turn radius, corkscrew roll
   rate, and other gaps that doc lists explicitly).

## Process rule: no patching (user, 2026-07-09)

V1 became unmaintainable through ten days of local patches layered on local patches. The standing
rule for V2 — both while building it and for all later fixes: **don't patch a defect in place;
fully rewrite or redo the affected unit** (the whole primitive, schedule, or check — not a guard
clause bolted on top), **and when the change overlaps neighbouring code, re-check the surrounding
system (up to the whole module) rather than trusting the seams.** Then re-run the acceptance
harness. If a fix feels like a one-line special case, that's the V1 pattern re-entering — step
back and rebuild the unit it belongs to.

## Why a rewrite is required

The current generator is a streaming state machine that alternates modes (`FLAT`, `DROP`,
`HILLS`, `TURN`, etc.), writes sparse ~14 m control points, then applies multiple corrective
passes: midpoint relaxation, g-based relaxation, terrain floor lifts, bank easing, and Catmull /
Hermite sampling. Those systems fight each other and create the reported symptoms:

- distinct pitch sections stitched together at a control point;
- tiny flattening before an element after a mild incline;
- drops that stop early or hand to an unrelated element instead of finishing their planned
  pull-out;
- terrain sampling that changes the intended vertical profile;
- wave-turn exits and banked-to-banked joins that require cosmetic repair;
- synthetic cliff logic coupled to track generation rather than a natural world feature.

Do not solve these with another post-hoc smoother. The path itself must be designed from
continuous primitives before it is sampled.

## Non-negotiable geometry rules

The detailed, cited references are [SHAPES.md](../docs/SHAPES.md) and
[TERRAIN_CONTRACT.md](../docs/TERRAIN_CONTRACT.md). In short:

1. Normal track must be C2 continuous: position, tangent, and curvature agree at joins.
2. A camelback is a symmetric parabolic-looking airtime hill with a parabolic core and smooth
   entry/exit blends. It has one crest point, never a flat crest run.
3. A launched top hat has sustained, approximately symmetric `+65°` / `−65°` faces and one
   short curvature-continuous crest transition. It is not a whole-parabola hill and not a
   collection of slope targets.
4. A turn has one curvature schedule and one matched roll schedule. A helix is a real spiral
   (`x/z` circular, `y` continuously pitched), not chained turns.
5. A cliff dive is chosen only at an independently generated natural escarpment. No runtime
   terrain mutation, mesa, cylinder, or track-aligned spike is permitted.

## Target architecture and file boundaries

Keep the renderer and physics-facing `Track` interface (`pos`, `tangent`, `upAt`, `tagAt`,
`chainAt`) stable. Replace only the producer behind it. Split V2 deliberately so geometry,
terrain, rendering, and diagnostics can be reviewed independently:

```text
opengl/src/track/
  track_types.h          pose, sample, tag, route and validation data
  track_math.{h,cpp}     arc-length integration, quintic/Bloss schedules, frame utilities
  track_primitives.cpp   line, connector, top hat, camelback, drop, turn and helix
  track_planner.cpp      whole-ride beats and candidate selection
  track_terrain.cpp      immutable terrain queries and escarpment scan
  track_validate.cpp     continuity, clearance and fixed-seed checks
  track_v2.cpp           renderer-compatible Track adapter
```

`main.cpp` should become host-only: world streaming, input, camera, rendering and game loop.
It must not contain track spline formulae, generation state, or route diagnostics. Renderer
backends should include the adapter interface, never a generator `.cpp` file.

```text
layout beats                 continuous primitives                fixed-arc samples
-------------               -----------------------              -----------------
launch / LSM          ->    pitch/yaw/roll schedules       ->    1–2 m route samples
top hat                      vertical transition + faces         position/tangent/up/tag
powered valley               plan turn + bank schedule           supports at separate spacing
natural escarpment           camelback / helix / drop
final launch                 clearance validator
```

### 1. Layout planner (whole ride, not per point)

Plan a finite list of beats before generating geometry. A Falcon-inspired default is:

```text
station → main launch → top hat → long descending transition
        → low terrain-hugging turns/hills → uphill LSM
        → naturally scanned escarpment → cliff dive / valley LSM
        → 165 m-class camelback → elongated high-speed turns/hills
        → brake/station
```

- Each beat has an entry pose (position, pitch, heading, roll), an exit pose, speed intent,
  clearance band, and minimum length.
- Choose the next beat before generating its connector. The connector must solve from the
  outgoing pose to the next incoming pose; never seek level ground first.
- Reject a beat if clearance or natural terrain prerequisites fail; choose another beat. Never
  truncate it to one or two samples and relabel the remainder.
- Use an explicit cadence budget: few long turns, mostly one-hill camelbacks, 2–4 inversions,
  and only intentional LSM/brake straights.

### 2. Primitive library

Parameterise every primitive by arc length `s`, then sample at fixed 1–2 m arc intervals.
Do not use 14 m sparse control points as the visible rail path.

| Primitive | Required parameterisation |
|---|---|
| Connector | Quintic pose interpolation or matched Euler/Bloss curvature transition. Input and output position, pitch, yaw, roll, curvature. |
| Turn | `yaw(s)` from an S-curve / clothoid-style curvature ramp, then a constant/broad-radius middle, then the mirrored ramp. Bank follows the same normalised schedule. |
| Top hat | Pitch schedule: entry transition `0 → +65°`, sustained `+65°` face, a single crest transition `+65° → −65°`, sustained `−65°` face, pull-out. |
| Camelback | Parabolic elevation core (`y = H[1 - ((x-xc)/a)^2]`) with C2 blends into the incoming/outgoing grades. Mirror the two halves unless deliberately building a descending hill chain. |
| Drop | Sustained descent plus a planned C2 pull-out into the following beat. It cannot terminate solely because terrain becomes close. |
| Helix | `x=xc+R cos φ`, `z=zc+R sin φ`, `y=y0-pφ/(2π)`, with smooth `φ'` onset/exit and continuous bank. |
| Cliff dive | Natural-ridge approach, outward-banked edge move, then a tangent-continuous vertical dive and pull-out. Reject if the scanned ridge/valley cannot deliver the requested drop. |

For the top-hat crest use a pitch function rather than a slope clamp. One good deterministic
form is, over crest parameter `u∈[0,1]`:

```text
θ(u) = θmax × (1 - 2 × S5(u))
S5(u) = 6u⁵ - 15u⁴ + 10u³
θmax = 65°
```

Integrate `dx/ds = cos θ`, `dy/ds = sin θ`. It has a single `θ=0` apex, matches a constant-grade
face with zero curvature at both ends, and cannot create a horizontal shelf.

### 3. Terrain contract

- Terrain is generated once from world seed; it is never altered by a ride element.
- Build natural escarpments as long, warped, erosion-varied noise ridges—not radial mesas—before
  the ride layout is planned.
- Route clearance validates against terrain after a primitive is proposed. **A shallow cut/tunnel
  is the default, preferred response to encroachment — not a last resort** (see `TERRAIN_CONTRACT.md`'s
  historical note: an earlier version overcorrected from a -100 m clearance bug into being afraid
  to ever carve terrain, which produced kinked, terrain-hugging track instead — don't repeat that).
  Reject/replan only when a cut/tunnel can't resolve it. Never a per-sample pitch edit or kink.
- The sea plane is independent of mountain relief. Keep most plains dry; water is for low basins.

### 4. Sampling, rendering, and camera

- Store dense route samples directly as the rail path. Rendering, train pose, camera, physics,
  ties, and supports must consume the same samples.
- Use analytic derivative from the primitive where possible. Do not finite-difference a separate
  Catmull path for the camera.
- Parallel-transport the frame along ordinary path samples. Apply designed bank as a rotation
  about the tangent; this avoids `upAt()` interpolation passing through unintended roll states.
- Place supports from a separate support-spacing pass (for example 18–30 m), not one support per
  geometry control point.

## What to remove or quarantine

- `M_FLAT` terrain-following as a generic connector.
- `connLatch`, `pendingPick`, and any 1–3 point safety handoff as a way to create geometry.
- Post-hoc midpoint smoothing, vertical g relaxation, terrain-floor ratchets, and tag-retouching
  as shape-generation mechanisms. Retain only read-only diagnostics initially.
- Runtime terrain injection / synthetic mesa logic. It is prohibited in V2.
- Generated wave turns. Until a dedicated primitive is implemented, map them to the single
  camelback primitive.

The V1 code and its diagnostics are intentionally quarantined as baseline code, not as a reference
implementation. **Do not copy or port any of it into V2** — not its state-machine fields, not its
target-slope rules, not its comments, not its formulas, not its overall approach or control flow.
Treating V1 as something to consult "just for how it handles X" is exactly how the old spaghetti
pattern re-enters V2 — every V1 fix was itself a patch on top of prior patches; there is no clean
layer in it worth extracting. If a V1 function's *name* or a comment nearby happens to describe a
real requirement (e.g., "cliff dive must aim at a scanned ridge"), treat that as a hint to verify
against `SHAPES.md`/`TERRAIN_CONTRACT.md`/`REALISM_SCALE.md` or fresh research — never as something
to read the implementing code for. Git history is the archive for historical tuning notes; no
previous handoff or TODO file, and no V1 source file, is normative for V2's design.

## Acceptance harness for V2

Run this before replacing the old generator:

1. **Continuity sweep:** sample each route at 0.25–0.5 m. Flag discontinuities in pitch, yaw,
   curvature, roll, and roll rate outside explicit station/brake boundaries.
2. **Top-hat test:** exactly one apex; zero consecutive flat samples at the crest; sustained
   `+60°…+70°` ascent and `−60°…−70°` descent; matched peak magnitudes within 5°.
3. **Camelback test:** one symmetric crest, no plateau, no terrain-induced mid-hill flattening.
4. **Drop test:** every drop reaches its planned pull-out or is rejected/replanned; no random
   element starts while still descending.
5. **Terrain test:** count cuts/tunnels, clearance, and water coverage separately. Verify no
   per-ride terrain mutation occurs.
6. **Visual regression:** render a fixed seed from first-person, chase, and side view; compare
   pitch/roll plots and images for each named primitive.
7. **Physics:** maintain no NaN/stall conditions, but treat g-force output as a diagnostic rather
   than the geometry authoring system.

## Migration sequence

1. Add the V2 modules and `TrackV2` adapter. Keep V1 out of the V2 call path.
2. Implement only line, connector, top-hat, camelback, and drop. Prove the continuity tests.
3. Add turn/bank and helix primitives with parallel-transport framing.
4. Add natural escarpment scan and cliff-dive primitive; no fallback tower.
5. Add inversion primitives one at a time.
6. Switch the OpenGL host to V2 after the fixed-seed visual and continuity suite passes.
7. Port the renderer backends to the V2 adapter, then retire the V1 generator + dead diagnostics.

**Status: steps 1–7 DONE (2026-07-10).** The live OpenGL host runs only the V2 `TrackV2`
generator. V1 (`coaster_track.cpp`, `coaster_elements_ext.cpp`, `audit_diagnostics.cpp`) was
**archived to `opengl/legacy/` — kept unbuilt and byte-identical to its original, for reference,
not deleted** (user decision, superseding "delete"). The V1-only CLI diagnostics were replaced by
the headless `--v2audit N` (build+validate N seeds). The OpenGL renderer is the only host; the
`vulkan/` + `win-rtx/` backend forks live quarantined in `../mythostest-forks/` and are still
un-ported to the V2 adapter (out of scope until resumed). **Outstanding:** the fixed-seed VISUAL
regression has not been run (this dev environment can't open a GL context — a human launch of
`./opengl/minecoaster` is needed); and the unsupported-span follow-up (see below).

### Step-6 host requirements (user, 2026-07-10)

- **The player never sees the track adjusting.** Generation (including all planner retries and
  validation) completes BEFORE the world is shown; the game presents only the finished, fixed
  ride. No incremental reveal, no visible re-planning, no V1-style streaming build-out.
- **World terrain may be adjusted** (its generator parameters — mountain coverage/amplitude,
  escarpment frequency — not per-ride mutation, which stays prohibited) so rides and relief
  cooperate: bounded cuts/tunnels stay the norm, kilometer-scale bores and near-zero cut usage
  are both failures. Terrain changes are global and seed-stable; verify the game visually after.
